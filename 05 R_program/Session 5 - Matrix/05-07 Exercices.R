#### Exercise 4 - Matrices ####

# 1. Create the following matrix and assign it to the variable "exercise_matrix":

#   col1 col2 col3
# a    1    2    3
# b    4    5    6
# c    7    8    9

exercise_matrix <- matrix(c(1:9),3, 3, byrow = TRUE,
                          dimnames = list(c('a','b','c'), c('col1','col2','col3')))


# 2. Add a new row named "d" with the values 10, 11, and 12 to the
# exercise_matrix and assign it to exercise_matrix2
exercise_matrix2 <- rbind(exercise_matrix, 'd'= c(10,11,12))

# 3. What are the new dimensions of exercise_matrix2?
dim(exercise_matrix2)

# 4. What is the length of exercise_matrix2??
length(exercise_matrix2)

# 5. Which operator can you use to find out if the number 6 is found in
# exercise_matrix?
6 %in% exercise_matrix

# 6. Using diag(), create an identity matrix and name it i_matrix. Then find the
# sum of exercise_matrix and i_matrix.
i_matrix <- diag(1, 3,3)
i_matrix
sum_exercise_matrix_and_i_matrix <- exercise_matrix + i_matrix

# 7. Provide 2 ways you could select the number 5 from exercise_matrix.
exercise_matrix
exercise_matrix[2, 2]
exercise_matrix['b', 'col2']
exercise_matrix[5]
exercise_matrix[[5]]
